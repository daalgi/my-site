# Cable-stayed bridge

The thesis of my master's degree in civil engineering consisted in a parametric study, design and calculation of a cable-stayed bridge, which passed over the Jucar River, in Carcaixent (Valencia, Spain).

The total length of the bridge was 165.5 m. After evaluating the most feasable structural systems, a 2-span cable-stayed bridge seemed the most suitable solution.

When I started to dig into the structural system of the cable-stayed bridges I found out that there were several key parameters influencing its global behaviour. I could have just followed some specialized book recommendations and trying to fit a solution, which would have saved me quite a few months of work, but I enjoy the process of solving problems and building tools to optimize the solutions, so I chose to perform multiple parametric studies that allowed me to decide the final design parameters.

## Global system

I started by developing a script to make parametric models in `ANSYS APDL`, which uses a `Fortran` syntax. The script would perform three main steps:
1. Model the bridge as a continuous beam with supports at the stays anchorages to estimate the needed preload and the maximum tensile forces.
2. Select the needed cables within a catalogue.
3. Model the complete bridge (deck, tower, and stays) and apply the different load cases.

The final solution had a main span of 130 m. The load was carried by 8 stay cables to the 59.7-m-height tower, which was restrained by the 8 back stay cables anchored to the 35.5-m side span and to the abutment.

Once the global system key parameters were set, it was time to design the details: the deck, the tower, and the anchorages.

- Tower
- Anchorages

## Deck

The deck depth was constrained 

## Tower

## Anchorages




A parametric study was carried out to determine the suitable number of cables, the spacing between them, the height of the pylon, etc. 

The DECK was chosen to be made of a COMPOSITE CONCRETE-STEEL cross-section. 

The deck, the pylon and the cables were structurally verified in accordance with current regulations.
