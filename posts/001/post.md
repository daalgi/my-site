# Cable-stayed bridge

The thesis of my master's degree in civil engineering consisted in a parametric study, design and calculation of a cable-stayed bridge, which passed over the Jucar River, in Carcaixent (Valencia, Spain).

The total length of the bridge was 165.5 m. After evaluating the most feasable structural systems, a 2-span cable-stayed bridge seemed the most suitable solution.

...parametric study, development of tools...

The final solution had a main span of 130 m. The load is carried by 8 stay cables to the 59.7-m-height tower, which is restrained by the 8 back stay cables anchored to the 35.5 m side span and abutment.

A parametric study was carried out to determine the suitable number of cables, the spacing between them, the height of the pylon, etc. 

The DECK was chosen to be made of a COMPOSITE CONCRETE-STEEL cross-section. 

The deck, the pylon and the cables were structurally verified in accordance with current regulations.
