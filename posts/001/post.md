# Cable-stayed bridge

The thesis of my master's degree in civil engineering consisted in a parametric study, design and calculation of a cable-stayed bridge, which passed over the Jucar River, in Carcaixent (Valencia, Spain).

The total length of the bridge was 140 m. After evaluating the most feasable structural systems, a cable-stayed bridge with two spans seemed the most suitable solution.


The geotechnic and the hydraulic constraints were analyzed. 

An alternative selection study was performed, which pointed out a CABLE-STAYED BRIDGE as most appropriate solution. 

A parametric study was carried out to determine the suitable number of cables, the spacing between them, the height of the pylon, etc. 

The DECK was chosen to be made of a COMPOSITE CONCRETE-STEEL cross-section. 

The deck, the pylon and the cables were structurally verified in accordance with current regulations.
