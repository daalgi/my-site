# Cable-stayed bridge

Thesis: Design and calculation of a bridge in the northern access to Carcaixent (Valencia) over the Jucar River (2012)

The geotechnic and the hydraulic constraints were analyzed. 

An alternative selection study was performed, which pointed out a CABLE-STAYED BRIDGE as most appropriate solution. 

A parametric study was carried out to determine the suitable number of cables, the spacing between them, the height of the pylon, etc. 

The DECK was chosen to be made of a COMPOSITE CONCRETE-STEEL cross-section. 

The deck, the pylon and the cables were structurally verified in accordance with current regulations.
